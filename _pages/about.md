Hi! I'm currently a Computer Science PhD candidate in [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen) and [Prof. Amelie Chi Zhou](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~amelieczhou/), and co-supervised by and [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/). Before HKBU, I got my Bachelor degree of HUST.


**Research Interests**

Democratizing Machine learning needs high efficiency, scalability, robustness and privacy. Achieving them needs to understand ML and systems first. Hope we can design an ML system to learn and generate knowledge at anywhere and anytime.

* ML optimization: Federated learning, Distributed deep learning, New optimizer, Dataset distillation, Hardware-friendly optimization.
* Efficient inference: Hardware-friendly inference, Compression, Sparsity, MoE routing.
* LLM enhancement: Data quality, LLM safety.

I'm open for academic collaborations. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.




News
======

* [2024.01] Our paper "FedImpro: Measuring and Improving Client Update in Federated Learning" is accepted at ICLR 2024. ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07011.pdf),[code](https://github.com/wizard1203/FedImpro)). This work trains the high-level neural network on reconstructed feature distributions, to accelerate FL training and enhance the model performance.
