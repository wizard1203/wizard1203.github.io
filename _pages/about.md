Hi! I'm currently a Computer Science PhD student in [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen) in 2020. Before HKBU, I got my Bachelor degree in HUST.

My current research interests includes:


* Federated Learning
* Distributed Deep Learning
* Accelerate Training and Inference of DNNs
