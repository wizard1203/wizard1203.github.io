Hi! I'm currently a Computer Science PhD candidate in [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen) from 2020, and co-supervised by [Prof. Amelie Chi Zhou](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~amelieczhou/) and [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/). Before HKBU, I got my Bachelor degree of HUST.


**Research Interests**

Democratizing Machine learning needs high efficiency, scalability, robustness and privacy. Achieving them needs to understand ML and systems first. Hope we can design an ML system to learn and generate knowledge at anywhere and anytime.

**Current focus**: Federated Learning, Distributed Deep Learning, Accelerate Training and Inference of DNNs
