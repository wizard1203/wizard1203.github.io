Hi! This year, I'm expected to graduate as a Computer Science PhD in [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen) and [Prof. Amelie Chi Zhou](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~amelieczhou/), and co-supervised by [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/). After PhD journey, I'm going to work as a Postdoctoral Fellow in HKUST under supervision of [Prof. Bo Li](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~bli/) and [Prof. Xiaowen Chu](https://sites.google.com/view/chuxiaowen). Before HKBU, I got my Bachelor degree of HUST.


**Research Interests**

Democratizing large deep learning models needs high efficiency, scalability, robustness and privacy. Achieving these goals needs to understand *both ML and systems* at first. To this end, I'm studying following aspects:

* Training: ML optimizer, Distributed training (and federated learning), HPO, ML-system co-designs, Fault-tolerance training.
* Inference: Memory saving, Model compression, MoE routing, Accelerating LLM inference (both edge and server).
* Understanding Deep Learning/LLM: How model/LLM is trained, how knowledge is stored in the model/LLM, how knowledge is retrieved from the model/LLM.
* Data-centric: RAG, Dataset selection, Data quality, Data generation.
* LLM privacy: Privacy preserved inference.

Hope that finally we can design an *ML system* to learn and generate knowledge at anywhere and anytime. I'm open for academic collaborations. If you are interested, please feel free to contact me.
