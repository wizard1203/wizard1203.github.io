<!-- # Infomation Abstracting and Elaboration in Post-ChatGPT Age -->


## Abstract


ChatGPT and other generative AI will generate a lot of information.

People have different perspectives on the same information. For instance, detailed information that may be redundant for an expert could be suitable for a beginner. Conversely, concise information that an expert finds time-efficient may be difficult for a novice to comprehend. Furthermore, people from different contexts may interpret information differently.

Therefore, an abundance of information on the internet can waste readers' time.

I suggest providing an abstract version (a few sentences), a concise version (several paragraphs), and a detailed version (sections with surveyed data and references) for each article. Additionally, the article should be contextualized.





## Detailed


ChatGPT and other generative AI will generate many information. ChatGPT and other generative AI models have revolutionized the field of natural language processing by enabling machines to understand and generate human language at a level that was previously thought impossible. These models can generate vast amounts of information on any given topic, from news articles to technical documents to social media posts. As a result, the amount of information available on the internet has exploded in recent years, and shows no signs of slowing down.

Persons have different views for the same information. Some detailed information for an expert maybe too much and redundant, but suitable for a beginner. Conversely, some concise information for an expert may be very time-efficient, but difficult to understand for beginners. Another example is that people in different contexts will understand information from different ways.

However, despite the abundance of information available, the challenge lies in ensuring that this information is accessible and understandable to everyone. People have different levels of knowledge and expertise, and may therefore require different levels of detail in the information they consume. For example, a detailed technical report may be overwhelming and redundant for someone with little knowledge in the field, but essential for an expert seeking in-depth analysis. Similarly, a concise summary may be time-efficient for someone with a deep understanding of the subject matter, but insufficient for someone who is new to the topic. Additionally, people from different backgrounds and contexts may interpret the same information in different ways, further highlighting the need for personalized and targeted information delivery.

Thus, too much information in Internet will waste much time of readers. Given the sheer volume of information available on the internet, it can be overwhelming for readers to sift through it all to find the information that is relevant and useful to them. This can lead to a significant waste of time, with readers spending hours searching for information and struggling to discern what is trustworthy and accurate. In some cases, the sheer volume of information can even lead to decision paralysis, where readers are unable to make a decision due to the overwhelming number of options available.

For each article, I suggest to provide its abstract version (in few sentences), concise version (several paragraphs), detailed version (sections, need to give some surveyed data, references), and provide the contexts of this article.

To address this challenge, it may be helpful to provide multiple versions of articles and other information resources. For example, an abstract version could provide a brief summary of the main points for readers who want a quick overview. A concise version could provide several paragraphs of information, tailored to the reader's level of expertise and background knowledge. A detailed version could provide more in-depth analysis, broken down into sections with references and survey data to support the arguments made. Additionally, providing context for each article could help readers better understand the significance of the information presented and how it relates to their own interests and needs. By providing multiple versions of each article, readers can more easily access the information that is most relevant and useful to them, without being overwhelmed by extraneous or redundant information.
